Instructions
-------------
Students should put code for their lab work in this package.
Lab work consists of two tasks:
   * Student challenges in class: instructor will issue challenges and
     students should write code to meet those challenges in a separate 
     custom class called "Challenges"

   * Student API: students should complete this lab by one week from today:
     Create a custom "DateUtilities" class similar to the one demonstrated 
     by your instructor. However, yours should use the new Java 8 Date/Time API.
     You must provide a minimum of two methods for converting Date/Time
     objects to formatted strings; and you must provide a minimum of two
     methods to convert formatted strings to Date/Time objects. And you must 
     provide at least one method for performing Date/Time arithmetic, such 
     as the number of months, days, minutes, etc., between two dates.
     Experimentation is crucial to your success!
